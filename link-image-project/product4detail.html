  <h2>Short description</h2>
  <p>
    A gang of thieves stage a daring heist from a secure vault deep below Princeton Universityâ€™s Firestone Library. Their loot is priceless, but Princeton has insured it for twenty-five million dollars.
    <br/>Bruce Cable owns a popular bookstore in the sleepy resort town of Santa Rosa on Camino Island in Florida. He makes his real money, though, as a prominent dealer in rare books. Very few people know that he occasionally dabbles in the black market of stolen books and manuscripts.
